      Bots
     </h2>
    </a>
    <p>
     Many commits in OpenStack are actually performed by bots, such as Gerrit, in charge of finishing code review processes. For the analysis of companies, we have ignored those commits.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition, data presented for the issue tracking system and mailing lists is based
           only on developers found in the versioning system. In other words, this analysis     shows information about developers activity (and their affiliations) through the three data sources. As an example, a developer of a given company with no activity in the Git is only considered for the global numbers, but not for the specific ones of such company.

     <h2>
      Affiliation
     </h2>
    </a>
    <p>
     Affiliation of developers to companies and other institutions has been done based on various heuristics, some of the automatic, some other manual. The base heuristic has bee using the domain part of the email address to identify an institution, and affiliation of the corresponding developer to it. We have also used some information provided by the OpenStack Foundation, and a git-dm config file used by OpenStack developers to do a similar analysis. We have complemented and validated this information in many cases by manual search in the Internet. As a result of this process, we have classified all developers as affiliated with an organization (which we refer in this report as "company"), as
     <a id="#note:analysis:non-affiliated">
      non-affiliated
     </a>
     , or as unknown (for which we couldn't decide to which company they were affiliated). We have also considered that developers may move from company to company, identifying for some of them the first or last date of work for their employers.
    </p>
    <a id="note:analysis:non-affiliated">
     <h2>
      Non-affiliated
     </h2>
    </a>
    <p>
     After doing some research, we have found some developers to be working on their own (be them volunteers or not). We consider them as non-affiliated. They have been found to have very little activity in total, compared to corporate activity.

     <h2>
      Unknown affiliation
     </h2>
    </a>
    <p>
     For some developers, we couldn't decide if they were affiliated to some company, or to which company in particular they were affiliated. We consider them as "with unknown affiliation".
