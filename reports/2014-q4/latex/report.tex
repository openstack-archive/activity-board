\textbf{Executive Summary}
\end{center}

The 2014 summary of OpenStack Community Activity Report\footnote{This report is produced quarterly to give Community Managers and OpenStack Foundation's management better insights on development activities and online conversations. The quantitative and qualitative assessment start from tracking actions across all OpenStack git repositories, gerrit code reviews, bug trackers as well as IRC channels, mailing lists and questions/answers.}  shows increasing activities compared to previous year on all accounts. The quantity of code being contributed, the developers involved and people interested in deploying OpenStack kept growing at fast pace in 2014.

In the past editions of the Report, the major source of concern with this fast growth has been quality of the code shipped, like the lead time to merge new patches. This year end report shows that some indicators seem to be improving: hopefully future reports will confirm the positive trends.  The indicators around bugs are still under special scrutiny since they're not changing much. The largest teams (Nova and Neutron, among others) introduced a bug liaison in the past months, hopefully these changes will lead to improved indicators.

\subsection*{Key findings:}
\begin{description}

\item[Coders community keeps growing mostly casual and regular ones] \hfill \\ 
The mean number of developers active in a given month peaked at 569 people during the third quarter (the highest numer in 2013 was 391). The total number of 'Core' contributors\footnote{This is the total count of developers responsible for delivering the 80\% of OpenStack's code} increased during 2014 but not as dramatically: the highest number in 2014 was 191 people, reached in third quarter (in 2013 the highest was 161 in fourth quarter).  Regular contributors\footnote{The count of developers responsible for delivering the 95\% of OpenStack's code} went from a max 245 in 2013 to 369 in 2014.

\item[Lead time to code additions improving] \hfill \\
Mean and median time to merge patches decreased for the first time after growing two years in a row. This is a good sign since many contributors have expressed visible frustration for this.  The time to wait for reviewers has decreased two quarters in a row (reviewers are getting faster) while original submitters are still much slower to respond to comments.

\item[Ask OpenStack gains popularity while mailing lists seem to decline] \hfill \\
With around 10,000 emails sent per quarter during 2014 the mailing lists seem to have reached a peak, while Ask OpenStack keeps gaining popularity. In 2014 there were regularly over 1,500 questions asked per quarter with matching amount of answers given.  The most frequently asked questions seem to be around OVS and Neutron. The mailing lists saw conversations about Nova automatic evacuation taking a lot of time. This quarter we saw changes in Nova and Neutron core reviewers, formation of the API Working Group, a first step to foster a new community of consumers of OpenStack API and more changes in Third-Party working group.

\chapter{Overview of the Project}

The OpenStack Community Activity Report is produced quarterly to give Community Managers and OpenStack Foundation's management better insights on development activities and online conversations. The  quantitative and qualitative assessment start from tracking actions across all OpenStack git repositories, gerrit code reviews, bug trackers as well as IRC channels, mailing lists and questions/answers site Ask OpenStack.

The report looks at activities across the OpenStack community during the fourth quarter of 2014, comparing it to previous eigth quarters.\footnote{The analyzed data sources are available in appendix\ref{chap:data_sources}}.

The analysis aims at providing a detailed view of how the OpenStack project is evolving with special focus on each of the OpenStack programs\footnote{Each of the projects mentioned are following the analysis of the Programs specified at \url{http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/governance/tree/reference/programs.yaml}. Besides, the hierarchy of projects and their repositories can be found at the correspondent appendix\ref{chap:data_sources}}. OpenStack Integrated Releases are delivered at the beginning of the second and fourth quarters of each year and cycles of development activity are visible in the report: the first and third quarters of the year are periods of higher activity while during the second and fourth ones show other recognizable patterns of activity in the OpenStack ecosystem.


A more detailed information about the community activity comparing two periods: 2013 and 2014, shows an increase in all of the analyzed data sources. Special focus on the increments in the question and answers tool\footnote{\url{https://ask.openstack.org}} and in the IRC channels\footnote{http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/}.

Regarding to the community, during the last quarter of 2014 there were 469 developers in mean per month, lower than the third quarter of 2014 (Juno release), but in line with the rest of the year activity and the releases cycle.

\end{tabular}

In addition in order to characterize developers, those are divided into three main sets: core, regular and casual\footnote{Contributing developers are characterized as core, regular and casual depending on their activity in the git repositories. The classification is built by sorting contributors by their total number of commits; we sum the total commits per each individual contributors: the individuals whose commits sum up to 80\% of the total number of commits in the quarter are the core contributors in that quarter. The regular contributors are those whose commits sum up to 95\% of the total. The others are the casual contributors.}.

%Difference between integrated and non-integrated projects in terms of efficiency closing issues, and time to review, mean and median.

%Areas of knowledge per company in the integrated projects.

%Newer projects tend to be faster closing issues, or at least, they are improving their times to review and attend tickets. 

Besides, this report aims at providing some insights about the software development process of the OpenStack community. This report measures efficiency and process of the community based on three metrics. The review efficiency index (REI), the time to merge, and the backlog management index (BMI). REI is measured as the number of closed (merged or abandoned) changesets out of the submitted changesets in a given period. Time to merge is measured as the time since a review is submitted until this is closed. And backlog management index is measured as the closed tickets out of the opened ticket in a given period. Typical review efficiency index values in the OpenStack Integrated projects rounds a 0.75, what indicates that for 100 opened changesets in a period, the community closes 75. Besides, the median Time to Merge is of 5.52 days, having a decrease from the previous period.

\chapter{Communication and Support-Related Activities}

The OpenStack community uses several channels for communication and support-related activities. Mailing lists were initially the key place for communications, although part of the activity is moving to
the questions and answers tool in the Ask OpenStack site.

\section{Mailing Lists}

The following charts show activity in terms of emails sent, people sending emails and 
people initiating threads per quarter. In addition, two tables are presented with the hot
topics in the several analyzed mailing lists. First table shows hot topics ordered by
number of total posts in such thread, while the second table shows hot topics ordered by
the total number of different participants in the discussions. The two tables are
based on the last quarter period of activity.

\section{Questions and Answers}

The following charts show activity in the Ask OpenStack site. Total number of questions,
number of answers, number of comments and people sending questions are depicted. In addition
four tables represent the hot topics activity in the Ask OpenStack site. Those show information
about the top visited questions, questions with the highest number of comments, questions with
the highest number of different people participating and the tags with the highest number
of references.

\section{IRC}

Finally, the community of OpenStack uses several IRC channels for asynchronous communication. 
This section shows information about the total number of messages sent in the community during 
the last 8 quarters together with the number of the several people participating in such discussions.
In addition, a list with the top participants in the IRC channels is provided.

\chapter{Per Project break down}

This chapter aims at providing a detailed report on the activity of the OpenStack Foundation projects.
This is mainly focused on the activity per project as defined, stressing the point on the 'integrated'  and 'incubated' projects.

The rest of the projects and a detailed view of the integrated and incubated projects have been
separated from this document version.

Each of the projects is divided into three sections and provides information from the last eight quarters: 
\begin{itemize}
\item activity: centered in the following metrics: commits from git activity, submitted, merge and abandoned reviews from the review system and
opened and closed tickets from the issue tracking system. 
\item community: active core reviewers in gerrit, active authors in Git and top ten developers and top ten organizations contributing to the development in the last quarter.
of each project.
\item process: efficiency closing tickets, efficiency closing changesets, Time to Merge (mean and median), number of patchsets (iterations) per changeset and study on the time waiting for a reviewer or submitter action in the patchset review process.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Metrics Definitions}
\label{chap:metrics_definitions}

Metrics depicted in each OpenStack program:

\begin{itemize}
\item Commit: this is defined as the action(s) that performes a change in the source code. 
Bots, merges and other type of automatic activity is removed from the records. Besides,
when aggregating several Gits, this metric only counts unique revisions (unique hashes found in the Git repositories).
Finally, all branches are aggregated to the analysis.

\item Submitted changeset: a changeset is the process of peer reviewing source code changes. A commit
is not merged to the master code of a given project till this is approved for at least one core
reviewer of such project. A submitted changeset is defined as any changeset submitted to the Gerrit
system. However, given the limitations of the current version of the tool, with at least 5,900 changesets
detected as having an erroneous creation date, this metric counts the first patchset upload action. 
 
\item Merged and abandoned changsets: a merge is defined as the patchset that was finally submitted to the 
source code. An abandoned changeset is a potential merge that was finally dismissed by developers as
being part of the source code. This status is found in the status of the final patchset. However, although
a patchset can be merged or abandoned, this action can be reverted. If a patchset presents several of 
these changes in the same period of time, only one of them is counted (the very last one). On the other hand,
if those changes take place in different periods of analysis, both status would be counted.

\item Open and closed ticket: a ticket in Launchpad is counted as closed if the status of such ticket is defined as 'Fix Released'.
The rest of the tickets are counted as opened tickets.

\item Active Core Reviewer: a core reviewer has the possibility to use +2 or -2 actions when reviewing the code. 
However, if there are developers that for some period do not use those actions, those can not be measured as core reviewer.
Thus, this metric provides information about 'active' core reviewers. This can be also defined as those developers
that actively have used the +2 or -2 review action. Besides, this metric is filtered by branch of activity, only using 'master'.
This helps to detect actual core reviewers in each of the projects.

\item Authors: a developer is defined as author if she is the owner of the patchset sent for reviewing and this is 
merged into the source code. As previously indicated, automatic commits such bot's are removed from this analysis.

\item Efficiency closing issues: this metric is a derivation of the Backlog Management Index (BMI) that measures the number
of closed tickets out of the opened tickets in a period of time. Values under 1.0 indicates that the number of closing
issues is lower than the number of opened issues arriving. On the contrary, higher charts would indicate better
maintenance effort by the community.

\item Efficiency closing changesets: this metric is a derivation of the Backlog Management Index as it is named as
Review efficiency index (REI). As similarly used in the BMI index, this metrics measures the number of closed changesets
(merged or abandoned) out of the total number of new changesets.

\item Time to Merge: this time consists of the time between the first upload of the first patchset (as defined
as a submitted changeset) till the last patchset of the changeset is merged into the code and this is indicated in the 
comments side of the Gerrit tool. This metric is provided in number of days.

\item Patchsets per changeset: this metric calculates the total number of iterations in a changeset till this is abandoned
or merged.

\item Time waiting for the reviewer or the submitter: a changeset is waiting for a reviewer action if a new patchset upload
or a new changset arrives to the system. On the other hand, a submitter action is required when a specific negative verification
or reviewing action takes place (Verified -1/-2 or Code-Review -1/-2). In addition, when a Code-Review +2 action takes place,
it is assumed that the changset is closing and no more times are registered either for the reviewer or the submitter.
For this analysis, those patchsets flagged as work in progress are ignored.

\end{itemize}

Metrics depicted in the general overview:

\begin{itemize}
\item Community structure, core, regular and casual developers: developers are ordered in descendant order by the
number of commits authored for a given period. Core developers are defined as the list of developers that 
reach 80\% of the total commits. Regular is the set of developers that are between that 80\% and 95\% of the commits.
Casual developers are found in the rest of the 5\%. Bots are ignored in this list of developers.

\item Developer per month: average of developers per month ignoring bots.

\item Emails sent: number of emails sent by people to the several mailing lists. Bots are not registered.

\item People sending emails: number of people sending those emails ignoring bots.

\item People initiating threads: a thread is defined as a list of emails that has the same root. There may exist
threads of one email.

\item Top threads: this list provides the longest threads in terms of number of emails that have a common root email.

\item Questions, answers and comments in Askbot.

\item People asking questions in Askbot: number of people sending a new question.

\item Top visited questions.

\item Top tags: each of the questions has a list of associated tags. The top tags  are those 
with the highest number of repetitions aggregating all of the questions.

\item Messages and people in IRC: this analysis ignores as a message those entries in the IRC channels that provide
information about people entering or leaving the system.  

\end{itemize}
